# Cooperative-Imitation-Learning-CIL
We propose a Cooperative Imitation Learning (CIL) method that exploits information from
both negative and positive trajectories to learn the optimal DTR.
•Cooperative Imitation Learning (CIL) learns optimal dynamic treatment regimes. •CIL method exploits information from both positive and negative trajectories.  •CIL provides better dynamic treatment regimes for people with alcohol addiction.
